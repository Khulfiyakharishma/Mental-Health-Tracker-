Mental Health Tracker System

Project Overview

The Mental Health Tracker System is a web-based application designed to assess a user’s mental well-being by analyzing inputs such as mood, stress level, and sleep quality. The system applies basic machine learning logic to classify mental health conditions and provide meaningful feedback to users.

This project was developed as a Mini Project for the Master of Computer Applications (MCA) program.

Objectives
⦁	To provide a simple platform for mental health self-assessment
⦁	To analyze mood, stress, and sleep patterns
⦁	To classify mental health conditions using machine learning logic
⦁	To store and manage user data securely
⦁	To create awareness about mental well-being

Features
⦁	Mood tracking through user inputs
⦁	Stress level analysis
⦁	Sleep quality monitoring
⦁	Machine learning-based mental health classification
⦁	User-friendly result display
⦁	Secure storage of user data
⦁	Web-based interface

Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: PHP
Database: MySQL
Machine Learning: Rule-based sensitivity analysis algorithm

System Architecture

⦁	The user provides mood, stress, and sleep data through the web interface
⦁	The input data is sent to the backend for processing
⦁	Machine learning logic analyzes the collected data
⦁	The system classifies the mental health condition
⦁	The result is displayed to the user
⦁	User data is stored securely in the database

Modules

⦁	User Input Module – Collects mood, stress, and sleep details
⦁	Analysis Module – Processes data using machine learning logic
⦁	Result Module – Displays mental health status
⦁	Database Module – Manages secure data storage

How to Run the Project

1.	Install XAMPP or WAMP Server
2.	Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/mental-health-tracker.git
3.	Move the project folder to: htdocs
4.	Start Apache and MySQL services
5.	Import the database file using phpMyAdmin
6.	Open a web browser and run: http://localhost/mental-health-tracker

Future Enhancements

⦁	Integration of advanced machine learning models
⦁	Mobile application support
⦁	Real-time mental health analytics and visualization
⦁	Chatbot-based mental health assistance
⦁	Notification and reminder system
